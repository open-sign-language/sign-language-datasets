# Sign Language Datasets Collection

This repository provides easy access to various sign language datasets through Hugging Face datasets. Our goal is to make sign language datasets more accessible to researchers, developers, and the community.

## Available Datasets

| Dataset Name | Language | Description | Size | Reference |
|--------------|----------|-------------|------|-----------|
| How2Sign | American Sign Language (ASL) | Large-scale multimodal dataset containing American Sign Language videos aligned with English speech and text. Includes instructional videos covering various topics. | 35,000 videos | [How2Sign Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08143) |
| RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014T | German Sign Language (DGS) | Contains weather forecast recordings from German public TV performed by professional sign language interpreters. Features continuous sign language, gloss annotations, and translations. | 8,257 videos | [PHOENIX Paper](https://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/publications/download/1064/Koller-LREC-2016.pdf) |

## Usage
